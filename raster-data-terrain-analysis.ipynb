Meanwhile, the visuals utilize graduated colors to focus less on the physical characteristics of the area, but rather the levels of slope in parcel. The DEM dataset used in this topology map is representing elevation values across Oxford, Ohio, while the zonal statistics in the slope map calculated means of the raster values within defined zones of Oxford, Ohio.**"
