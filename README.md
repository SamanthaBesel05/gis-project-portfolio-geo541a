## Overview
- This repository contains Google Colab Notebooks prepared for GEO 441/541 at Miami University during the Fall 2025 semester.

## Basic Mapping

- [First map in ArcGIS Pro](basic-mapping/first-arcgis-mapping.ipynb)
- An overview of creating maps in ArcGIS Pro and how to include them into Google Colab.

## Vector Data Visualization

- [Map of U.S. county age indexes based on 2000 census data](vector-data-tables.ipynb)
- Using vector data, I analzyed which counties were high population with high old/young ratios.

## Raster Data Visualization

- Conducted a terrain analysis on Oxford, Ohio with the usage of raster data.

## Spatial Data Analysis
- [Maps of John Snow's Cholera Outbreak Invesitation in Soho](vector-data/spatial-analysis.ipynb)
- Using vector data, I conducted a spatial analysis on the cholera deaths in the Soho District, London (in 1854), where I looked at cholera deaths inside a 100m buffer of water pumps.
