I took a few CCP computer courses when I was high school, so I am very familiar with pathways in my File Explorer and how to manage them. I had the least difficulty with importing this data when compared to other steps in this assignment.\n",
        "  - Map creation and annotation\n",
        "    - While the steps provided in this assignment helped me create my maps, I found that some parts of the map customization were more difficult. With the variety of property options available, it took me some time to figure out how to change the font style and size for my legend and the title text. However, once I found where the customization options were located, it took me less time to complete my maps.\n",
        "  - Software interface navigation\n",
        "    - I felt like I would have been lost without the steps provided by the assignment's guide, but having the guide readily available to me on Canvas allowed me to easily navigate the software. Each of the steps showed the variety of tabs that can be utilized for map customization and design, and it reminded me of the Microsoft Office tools I have used frequently throughout my college courses. After a couple weeks of practice with the software, I should feel more confident in navigating it."
